# Transaction Fraud Detection

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on analyzing the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset, which includes both training and testing datasets. The primary objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection system for credit card transactions. We will conduct exploratory data analysis on the training dataset to identify potential correlations between features and fraudulent activities. Subsequently, we will build predictive models using these significant features and evaluate their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Notebook Content

The project is organized into several sections within a Jupyter Notebook. Here's a brief overview of each section:

### 1.0 Load Requirements and Imports
In this section, we import the necessary libraries and dependencies required to run the project. This includes Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### 2.0 Load Data and Analyze It
In this section, we load the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset and perform an initial analysis. This analysis includes exploring the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and data visualization to gain insights into the data.

### 3.0 Data Modeling and Prediction
This section is dedicated to building and evaluating predictive models for fraud detection.

#### 3.1 Preprocessing Train and Test Data
Before building models, we preprocess the training and testing data. This includes data cleaning, feature selection, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

#### 3.2 SMOTE Method
We employ the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance issues in the dataset. SMOTE helps create synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

#### 3.3 Preparing the Model and Making Predictions
In this final subsection, we prepare a Logistic Regression Model for fraud detection. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models on the preprocessed data, and making predictions. We evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics to assess its ability to detect fraudulent transactions.
